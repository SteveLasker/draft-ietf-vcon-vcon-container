# VCON BOF Charter Proposal

## Introduction and Group Overview

The generation of conversational data, contained in transcripts and multi-media files, is common in business, especially in customer facing organizations.
However, the storage, analysis and sharing of the data they contain is not currently a standard.
Standardizing a container for conversation data (vCon) has numerous advantages, and enables the management of the conversation's content.
For instance, a standard allows for tools to determine the contents of the conversation, such that privacy guarantees and duties can be accurately performed.
Having a standard container for conversation data also allows for easier management of conversation data, privacy concerns and management of party related data.

The VCON working group will define a standard container for conversation data and specify mechanisms to ensure the integrity and privacy of the data in the container.

  * Define a JSON based standard container and Media type to contain and/or reference conversational data including: call style meta data, recordings, data exchanged or presented in the conversations, conversation analysis, transcriptions, translations and annotations

  * Real-time streaming or updating of conversational data
  * Transport mechanisms
  * Storage or databases specifications

## Products

This group will produce:
  * Specification for a JSON based container for conversation data
  * Recommendations or analysis of missing (not defined) data containers and media types for components of the conversation data
